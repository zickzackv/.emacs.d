# My Emacs Configuration 

As a freelancing programmer ist tweaked towards an editor for 
programming. My currently used Languages are Ruby, Common Lisp and a bit Haskell.

This emacs configuration is heavily based on anything. It uses the 
Mac OS X  Command Key for acccessing some of the anything sources.
It oriented a bit toward TextMate, but does not use the TextMate.el
mode. Some of TextMates functionality is copied with the help of 
emacs modes.

## Used modes

When accessible I used GitHub Sources for modes.

- Anything
- Magit
- YASnippet
- full-ack
- eproject
- slime
- rhtml
- yaml
